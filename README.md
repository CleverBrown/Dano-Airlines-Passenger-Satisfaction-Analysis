# Dano Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis

Background/Objective 
Dano Airlines is a UK-based airline headquartered in London. Following the release of its latest passenger survey, the overall satisfaction rate has fallen below the 50% threshold for the first time. The objective of this analysis is to identify the reason for the decline and provide recommendations to improve passenger satisfaction and restore confidence in the airline.

## Key Performance Indicators
- Total Passengers: 129,880
- Satisfied Passengers: 56,428
- Dissatisfied Passengers: 73,452
- Satisfaction Rate: 43%

## Insights

### Overall Satisfaction Is Critically Low

Only 43% of passengers reported being satisfied, while 57% were dissatisfied. This imbalance represents a serious customer experience risk and signals that current service levels are no longer meeting passenger expectations at scale

### Service Quality Is Average, Not Exceptional

Most core service ratings fall between 2.8 and 3.6 out of 5 — not poor, but not excellent. The lowest-rated services include:
- In-flight Wi-Fi (2.8)
- Ease of online booking (2.9)
- Gate location clarity (3.0)
- Food and drink, departure and arrival time convenience (3.2)

### Economy Passengers Are Significantly Less Satisfied

Satisfaction rate by class shows a strong imbalance:
- Business Class: 69%
- Economy Plus: 25%
- Economy: 19%
Satisfaction drops sharply outside Business Class. The majority of dissatisfaction comes from Economy passengers, who likely represent the largest volume of customers. This indicates that Economy and Economy Plus passengers are not receiving a service experience that meets expectations.

### Satisfaction rate of First-Time Customers is significantly lower than that of Returning Customers

Satisfaction rate of First-Time Customers (33%) is significantly lower than that of Returning Customers (67%), suggesting a poor first impression.

### Satisfaction by Type of Travel

•	Business Travel: 85% satisfaction
•	Personal Travel: 15% satisfaction

This difference is likely because business travelers generally receive better service and fly on more reliable routes. Since their trips are often paid for by employers, they tend to be less sensitive to costs. In contrast, personal travelers pay out of pocket and are therefore more affected by delays, extra charges, and service disruptions, which may contribute to their lower overall satisfaction rate.

### Satisfaction by Age Group

- Adults (26–50): 48%
- Seniors (51+): 46%
- Young Adults (18–25): 35%
- Under 18: 17%

Younger passengers are the least satisfied. This group is more likely to value technology, Wi-Fi quality, ease of booking, and entertainment, which aligns with the lowest-rated service areas.

### Satisfaction by Flight Distance

- Long-haul flights: 77% satisfaction
- Medium-haul flights: 65% satisfaction
- Short-haul flights: 35% satisfaction
Short-haul flights have the lowest satisfaction rate, suggesting these routes may be neglected, possibly due to assumptions that “short flights require less service.” However, passengers still expect comfort, efficiency, and value regardless of flight duration.

## Recommendations
### Improve Short-Haul Experience

- Introduce visible upgrades on short-haul flights (seat comfort, quicker boarding, better food options), to ensure service quality consistency across all flight distances, not just long-haul.
  
### Invest in Digital Experience

- Upgrade in-flight Wi-Fi reliability and speed.
- Simplify online booking and check-in processes.
- Improve airport navigation support.

### Focus on improving First-Time Passenger Experience

- Create a “First-Time Flyer Experience” with clear communication, onboard guidance, and post-flight feedback engagement.

### Target Younger Passengers

- Improve connectivity and entertainment for younger passengers

### Protect and Improve Existing Strengths to Make Them Exceptional and Competitive

- Maintain high Business Class and business travel standards.
- Apply lessons from successful segments to underperforming ones.
